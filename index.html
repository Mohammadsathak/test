                                                    Once upon a time there was a
                                                    Princess. Many a suitor came to the palace to win her hand in
                                                    marriage, but it seemed to the Princess that each one of them looked
                                                    at her without really seeing her at all.

                                                    “They act like there’s nothing more to a princess than her fine
                                                    crown and royal dresses,” she said to herself with a frown.

                                                    One afternoon after one of these visits, the Princess thought,
                                                    “Sometimes I wish I were little again.”

                                She found her favorite ball from childhood, the one that
                                sparkled when she threw it up high to the sun. 
                                One time she threw it extra high and when she ran to catch the ball, she tripped on a
                                tree stump. The ball fell and plopped right down into the royal well!
                                “Oh no!” she moaned, “This is terrible!” Just then a small green frog poked its head
                                above the water.

                                “Maybe I can help you,”said the Frog.

                                            “No problem,” said the Frog. “But first there’s something I must ask of
                                            you.”
                                            “It’s for you to spend time with me today,” said the Frog.

                                            “I’m not sure I know what that means,” said the Princess.

                                            “Just spend time with me today,” repeated the Frog."All right then, fine!”
                                            said the Princess. “Now please, get my ball!

                                            “I already did,” she said with a shrug. And the Princess walked back to the
                                            palace.

                                            That night at dinner with her family and the royal advisers, there was a
                                            knock on the door. The servant opened the door and saw no one there. The
                                            Frog, standing down low, cleared his throat.

                                            “Daughter!” said the King from the far end of the table. “Did you promise to
                                            spend time with this Frog, as he claims?”

                                            “Sort of,” said the Princess. After a pause, she added, “Oh very well, come
                                            on in.”

                                       The servants quickly set a new place
                                            setting for the Frog, and he hopped over to the royal dining table.
                                            “Father, if I may,” said the Princess. “Perhaps we could–“

                                            “Stop!” said the King, cutting her off. “I have enough advisors, believe
                                            me.”

                                            After dinner, the Frog bowed to the Princess. He said, “You have done what
                                            you said you would do. I suppose it’s time now for me to go.”

                                            “No wait!” said the Princess, “it’s not that late. How about a walk in the
                                            garden?”

                                            “I had a very good time, too,” said the Frog.

                                            “Who knew?” said the Princess with a laugh. She leaned over and kissed the
                                            Frog lightly on his cheek.

                                            jumped back in surprise, and who could blame her? The Prince quickly told
                                            her not to worry, that all was well.
                                            Now the Prince and Princess could get to know each other better. Years
                                            later, after they were married, they had a beautiful setting made for the
                                            ball and placed it on their royal dining table. And when the sunlight shone
                                            in through the palace windows, the ball sparkled for all to see.
